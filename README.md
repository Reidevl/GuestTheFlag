# Guess The Flag

## Introduction

This is a project that I developed following the 100 Days of SwiftUI tutorial in HackingWithSwift.com. The main functionality is guess the country how belongs the flag shown.
I made some modifications in the project structure to improve it and I also handled some attributes such as @StateObject, @ObservedObject and ViewModel, that allow me improving the code quality without harming the app's reactivity
